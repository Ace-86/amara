Well, in that case, I'll just have to work extra hard to make sure both you and Stephanie are on top of things so that you can focus on taking care of little Nola.

Maybe you can help Nola with her alphabet once she gets a little bit older."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course, I'd be happy to assist Nola with learning her ABCs when the time comes.

Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are water-soluble acids that work on the surface of the skin, while beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) are oil-soluble acids that can penetrate deeper into the pores. AHAs are ideal for treating surface-level concerns like fine lines and sun damage, while BHAs are better suited for unclogging pores and treating acne and blemishes. As always, be sure to patch test any new products and consult a dermatologist if you have any concerns."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you, Amara. Just make sure to keep your answers short."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it, Aaron. I'll keep my responses brief and to the point from now on."}]
